# AGB_LIPO

THESE MAY STILL REQUIRE MORE TWEAKS BEFORE THEY WORK PROPERLY! Please do not make one if you are not afraid of having to modify the board to get it to work. See the video linked down below for more information. The files have since been updated but not yet tested. 

LiPo adapter for Game Boy Advance. Same concept as my AGS adapters: https://github.com/makhowastaken/AGS_LIPO

* Uses these battery terminals: https://il.farnell.com/keystone/5330/battery-contact-aaa-aaaa-n-12v/dp/1888418
but due to the absurd cost of shipping, I bought these instead: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32884289489.html
* a standard TP4056 module (Micro USB or USB C): https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32649780468.html
* and pretty much whatever diode you can get your hands on: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32664545131.html

I got my boards in and had to make some alterations to get them to fit better. I ordered new battery terminals again but I did try with some of the terminals I already had: https://youtu.be/GEl8VRI-Jl0

Per a recommendation from a user on my youtube channel (thanks Jonathan M Santos), it looks I've found suitable batteries that will fit with no or minimal modification. 103040 (1200mAh) batteries fit with absolutely zero modification to the AGB, and 103048 (1455mAh) batteries fit with a small trim to the plastic in the battery compartment.
